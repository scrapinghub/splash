Splash is a JavaScript rendering service developed by the folks at `Scrapinghub`_ to bring JavaScript support to web scrapers. It is a lightweight headless browser with a HTTP API so any service can use it to render pages that require JavaScript.

It's fast, lightweight and state-less, which makes it easy to distribute.
