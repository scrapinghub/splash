Splash Lua API Overview
-----------------------

Splash provides a lot of methods, functions and properties; all of them are
documented in :ref:`scripting-reference`, :ref:`scripting-libs`,
:ref:`splash-element`, :ref:`splash-request`, :ref:`splash-response`
and :ref:`binary-data`. Here is a short description of the most used ones:

Script as an HTTP API endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Splash Lua script can be seen as an HTTP API endpoint, with input
arguments and structured result value. For example, you can emulate
:ref:`render.png` endpoint using Lua script, including all its
HTTP arguments.

* :ref:`splash-args` is the way to get data to the script;
* :ref:`splash-set-result-status-code` allows to change HTTP status code
  of the result;
* :ref:`splash-set-result-content-type` allows to change Content-Type
  returned to the client;
* :ref:`splash-set-result-header` allows to add custom HTTP headers to the result;
* :ref:`binary-data` section describes how to work with non-text data in
  Splash, e.g. how to return it to the client;
* :ref:`lib-treat` library allows to customize the way data is serialized
  to JSON when returning the result.

Navigation
~~~~~~~~~~

* :ref:`splash-go` - load an URL to the browser;
* :ref:`splash-set-content` - load specified content (usually HTML)
  to the browser;

  lock/unlock navigation;
* :ref:`splash-set-user-agent` allows to change User-Agent header used
  for requests;
* :ref:`splash-set-custom-headers` allows to set default HTTP headers
  Splash use.
* :ref:`splash-on-request` allows to filter out or replace requests to
  related resources; it also allows to set HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy servers
  per-request;
* :ref:`splash-on-response-headers` allows to filter out requests
  based on their headers (e.g. based on Content-Type);
* :ref:`splash-init-cookies`, :ref:`splash-add-cookie`,
  :ref:`splash-get-cookies`, :ref:`splash-clear-cookies` and
  :ref:`splash-delete-cookies` allow to manage cookies.

Delays
~~~~~~

* :ref:`splash-wait` allows to wait for a specified amount of time;
* :ref:`splash-call-later` schedules a task in future;
* :ref:`splash-wait-for-resume` allows to wait until a certain JS event
  happens;
* :ref:`splash-with-timeout` allows to limit time spent in a code block.

Extracting information from a page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* :ref:`splash-html` returns page HTML content, after it is rendered
  by a browser;
* :ref:`splash-url` returns current URL loaded in the browser;
* :ref:`splash-evaljs` and :ref:`splash-jsfunc` allow to extract data from
  a page using JavaScript;
* :ref:`splash-select` and :ref:`splash-select-all` allow to run CSS
  selectors in a page; they return Element objects which has many
  methods useful for scraping and further processing
  (see :ref:`splash-element`)
* :ref:`splash-element-text` returns text content of a DOM element;
* :ref:`splash-element-bounds` returns bounding box of an element;
* :ref:`splash-element-styles` returns computed styles of an element;
* :ref:`splash-element-form-values` return values of a ``<form>`` element;
* many methods and attributes of DOM HTMLElement_ are supported - see
  :ref:`splash-element-dom-methods` and :ref:`splash-element-dom-attributes`.

Screenshots
~~~~~~~~~~~

* :ref:`splash-png`, :ref:`splash-jpeg` - take PNG or JPEG screenshot;
* :ref:`splash-set-viewport-full` - change viewport size (call it before
  :ref:`splash-png` or :ref:`splash-jpeg`) to get a screenshot of the whole
  page;
* :ref:`splash-set-viewport-size` - change size of the viewport;
* :ref:`splash-element-png` and :ref:`splash-element-jpeg` - take screenshots

  :ref:`splash-element-submit`;
* :ref:`splash-scroll-position` allows to scroll the page;
