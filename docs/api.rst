Splash HTTP API
===============

Consult with :ref:`install-docs` to get Splash up and running.

Splash is controlled via HTTP API. For all endpoints below parameters
may be sent either as GET arguments or encoded to JSON and
POSTed with ``Content-Type: application/json`` header.

Most versatile endpoints that provide all Splash features
are :ref:`execute` and :ref:`run`; they allow to execute arbitrary Lua
rendering scripts.

Other endpoints may be easier to use in specific
cases - for example, :ref:`render.png` returns a screenshot in PNG format
that can be used as `img src` without any further processing, and
:ref:`render.json` is convenient if you don't need to interact with a page.


.. _render.html:

render.html
-----------

Return the HTML of the javascript-rendered page.

Arguments:

.. _arg-url:

url : string : required
  The url to render (required)

.. _arg-baseurl:

baseurl : string : optional
  The base url to render the page with.

  Base HTML content will be feched from the URL given in the url
  argument, while relative referenced resources in the HTML-text used to
  render the page are fetched using the URL given in the baseurl argument
  as base. See also: :ref:`render-html-doesnt-work`.

.. _arg-timeout:

timeout : float : optional
  A timeout (in seconds) for the render (defaults to 30).

  By default, maximum allowed value for the timeout is 90 seconds.
  To override it start Splash with ``--max-timeout`` command line option.
  For example, here Splash is configured to allow timeouts up to 5 minutes::

      $ docker run -it -p 8050:8050 scrapinghub/splash --max-timeout 300

.. _arg-resource-timeout:

resource_timeout : float : optional
  A timeout (in seconds) for individual network requests.

  See also: :ref:`splash-on-request` and its
  ``request:set_timeout(timeout)`` method; :ref:`splash-resource-timeout`
  attribute.

.. _arg-wait:

wait : float : optional
  Time (in seconds) to wait for updates after page is loaded
  (defaults to 0). Increase this value if you expect pages to contain
  setInterval/setTimeout javascript calls, because with wait=0
  callbacks of setInterval/setTimeout won't be executed. Non-zero
  :ref:`wait <arg-wait>` is also required for PNG and JPEG rendering when
  doing full-page rendering (see :ref:`render_all <arg-render-all>`).

  Wait time must be less than :ref:`timeout <arg-timeout>`.

.. _arg-proxy:

proxy : string : optional
  Proxy profile name or proxy URL. See :ref:`Proxy Profiles`.

  A proxy URL should have the following format:
  ``[protocol://][user:password@]proxyhost[:port])``

  Where protocol is either ``http`` or ``socks5``. If port is not specified,
  the port 1080 is used by default.

.. _arg-js:

js : string : optional
  Javascript profile name. See :ref:`Javascript Profiles`.

.. _arg-js-source:

js_source : string : optional
    JavaScript code to be executed in page context.
    See :ref:`execute javascript`.

.. _arg-filters:

filters : string : optional
  Comma-separated list of request filter names. See `Request Filters`_

.. _arg-allowed-domains:

allowed_domains : string : optional
  Comma-separated list of allowed domain names.
  If present, Splash won't load anything neither from domains
  not in this list nor from subdomains of domains not in this list.

.. _arg-allowed-content-types:

allowed_content_types : string : optional
  Comma-separated list of allowed content types.
  If present, Splash will abort any request if the response's content type
  doesn't match any of the content types in this list.
  Wildcards are supported using the `fnmatch <https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html>`_
  syntax.

.. _arg-forbidden-content-types:

forbidden_content_types : string : optional
  Comma-separated list of forbidden content types.
  If present, Splash will abort any request if the response's content type
  matches any of the content types in this list.
  Wildcards are supported using the `fnmatch <https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html>`_
  syntax.

.. _arg-viewport:

viewport : string : optional
  View width and height (in pixels) of the browser viewport to render the web
  page. Format is "<width>x<height>", e.g. 800x600.  Default value is 1024x768.

  'viewport' parameter is more important for PNG and JPEG rendering; it is supported for
  all rendering endpoints because javascript code execution can depend on
  viewport size.

  For backward compatibility reasons, it also accepts 'full' as value;
  ``viewport=full`` is semantically equivalent to ``render_all=1`` (see
  :ref:`render_all <arg-render-all>`).

.. _arg-images:

images : integer : optional
    Whether to download images. Possible values are
    ``1`` (download images) and ``0`` (don't download images). Default is 1.

    Note that cached images may be displayed even if this parameter is 0.
    You can also use `Request Filters`_ to strip unwanted contents based on URL.

.. _arg-headers:

headers : JSON array or object : optional
    HTTP headers to set for the first outgoing request.

    This option is only supported for ``application/json`` POST requests.
    Value could be either a JSON array with ``(header_name, header_value)``
    pairs or a JSON object with header names as keys and header values
    as values.

    "User-Agent" header is special: is is used for all outgoing requests,
    unlike other headers.

.. _arg-body:

body : string : optional
    Body of HTTP POST request to be sent if method is POST.
    Default ``content-type`` header for POST requests is ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded``.

.. _arg-http-method:

http_method : string : optional
    HTTP method of outgoing Splash request. Default method is GET. Splash also
    supports POST.

.. _arg-save-args:

save_args : JSON array or a comma-separated string : optional
    A list of argument names to put in cache. Splash will store each
    argument value in an internal cache and return ``X-Splash-Saved-Arguments``
    HTTP header with a list of SHA1 hashes for each argument
    (a semicolon-separated list of name=hash pairs)::

        name1=9a6747fc6259aa374ab4e1bb03074b6ec672cf99;name2=ba001160ef96fe2a3f938fea9e6762e204a562b3

    Client can then use :ref:`load_args <arg-load-args>` parameter
    to pass these hashes instead of argument values. This is most useful
    when argument value is large and doesn't change often
    (:ref:`js_source <arg-js-source>` or :ref:`lua_source <arg-lua-source>`
    are often good candidates).

.. _arg-load-args:

load_args : JSON object or a string : optional
    Parameter values to load from cache.
    ``load_args`` should be either ``{"name": "<SHA1 hash>", ...}``
    JSON object or a raw ``X-Splash-Saved-Arguments`` header value
    (a semicolon-separated list of name=hash pairs).

    For each parameter in ``load_args`` Splash tries to fetch the
    value from the internal cache using a provided SHA1 hash as a key.
    If all values are in cache then Splash uses them as argument values
    and then handles the request as usual.

    If at least on argument can't be found Splash returns **HTTP 498** status
    code. In this case client should repeat the request, but
    use :ref:`save_args <arg-save-args>` and send full argument values.

    :ref:`load_args <arg-load-args>` and :ref:`save_args <arg-save-args>`
    allow to save network traffic by not sending large arguments with each
    request (:ref:`js_source <arg-js-source>` and
    :ref:`lua_source <arg-lua-source>` are often good candidates).

    Splash uses LRU cache to store values; the number of entries is limited,
    and cache is cleared after each Splash restart. In other words, storage
    is not persistent; client should be ready to re-send the arguments.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Curl example::

    curl 'http://localhost:8050/render.html?url=http://domain.com/page-with-javascript.html&timeout=10&wait=0.5'

The result is always encoded to utf-8. Always decode HTML data returned
by render.html endpoint from utf-8 even if there are tags like

::

   <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">

in the result.

.. _render.png:

render.png
----------

Return a image (in PNG format) of the javascript-rendered page.

Arguments:

Same as `render.html`_ plus the following ones:

.. _arg-width:

width : integer : optional
  Resize the rendered image to the given width (in pixels) keeping the aspect
  ratio.

.. _arg-height:

height : integer : optional
  Crop the renderd image to the given height (in pixels). Often used in
  conjunction with the width argument to generate fixed-size thumbnails.

.. _arg-render-all:

render_all : int : optional
  Possible values are ``1`` and ``0``.  When ``render_all=1``, extend the
  viewport to include the whole webpage (possibly very tall) before rendering.
  Default is ``render_all=0``.

  .. note::

      ``render_all=1`` requires non-zero :ref:`wait <arg-wait>` parameter. This is an
      unfortunate restriction, but it seems that this is the only way to make
      rendering work reliably with ``render_all=1``.

.. _arg-scale-method:

scale_method : string : optional
  Possible values are ``raster`` (default) and ``vector``.  If
  ``scale_method=raster``, rescaling operation performed via :ref:`width
  <arg-width>` parameter is pixel-wise.  If ``scale_method=vector``, rescaling
  is done element-wise during rendering.

  .. note::

     Vector-based rescaling is more performant and results in crisper fonts and
     sharper element boundaries, however there may be rendering issues, so use
     it with caution.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Curl examples::

    # render with timeout
    curl 'http://localhost:8050/render.png?url=http://domain.com/page-with-javascript.html&timeout=10'

    # 320x240 thumbnail
    curl 'http://localhost:8050/render.png?url=http://domain.com/page-with-javascript.html&width=320&height=240'


.. _render.jpeg:

render.jpeg
-----------

Return a image (in JPEG format) of the javascript-rendered page.

Arguments:

Same as `render.png`_ plus the following ones:

.. _arg-quality:

quality : integer : optional
  JPEG quality parameter in range from ``0`` to ``100``.
  Default is ``quality=75``.

  .. note::

      ``quality`` values above ``95`` should be avoided;
      ``quality=100`` disables portions of the JPEG compression algorithm,
      and results in large files with hardly any gain in image quality.


Examples
~~~~~~~~

Curl examples::

    # render with default quality
    curl 'http://localhost:8050/render.jpeg?url=http://domain.com/'

    # render with low quality
    curl 'http://localhost:8050/render.jpeg?url=http://domain.com/&quality=30'


.. _render.har:

render.har
----------

Return information about Splash interaction with a website in HAR_ format.
It includes information about requests made, responses received, timings,
headers, etc.

You can use online `HAR viewer`_ to visualize information returned from
this endpoint; it will be very similar to "Network" tabs in Firefox and Chrome
developer tools.

Currently this endpoint doesn't expose raw request contents;
only meta-information like headers and timings is available.
Response contents is included when
:ref:`'response_body' <arg-response-body-0>` option is set to 1.

Arguments for this endpoint are the same as for `render.html`_, plus the
following:

.. _arg-response-body-0:

response_body : int : optional
  Possible values are ``1`` and ``0``.  When ``response_body=1``,
  response content is included in HAR records. Default is ``response_body=0``.


.. _HAR: http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/
.. _HAR viewer: http://www.softwareishard.com/har/viewer/


.. _render.json:

render.json
-----------

Return a json-encoded dictionary with information about javascript-rendered
webpage. It can include HTML, PNG and other information, based on
arguments passed.

Arguments:

Same as `render.jpeg`_ plus the following ones:

.. _arg-html:

html : integer : optional
    Whether to include HTML in output. Possible values are
    ``1`` (include) and ``0`` (exclude). Default is 0.

.. _arg-png:

png : integer : optional
    Whether to include PNG in output. Possible values are
    ``1`` (include) and ``0`` (exclude). Default is 0.

.. _arg-jpeg:

jpeg : integer : optional
    Whether to include JPEG in output. Possible values are
    ``1`` (include) and ``0`` (exclude). Default is 0.

.. _arg-iframes:

iframes : integer : optional
    Whether to include information about child frames in output.
    Possible values are  ``1`` (include) and ``0`` (exclude).
    Default is 0.

.. _arg-script:

script : integer : optional
    Whether to include the result of the executed javascript final
    statement in output (see :ref:`execute javascript`).
    Possible values are ``1`` (include) and ``0`` (exclude). Default is 0.

.. _arg-console:

console : integer : optional
    Whether to include the executed javascript console messages in output.
    Possible values are ``1`` (include) and ``0`` (exclude). Default is 0.

.. _arg-history:

history : integer : optional
    Whether to include the history of requests/responses for webpage main
    frame. Possible values are ``1`` (include) and ``0`` (exclude).
    Default is 0.

    Use it to get HTTP status codes and headers.
    Only information about "main" requests/responses is returned
    (i.e. information about related resources like images and AJAX queries
    is not returned). To get information about all requests and responses
    use :ref:`'har' <arg-har>` argument.

.. _arg-har:

har : integer : optional
    Whether to include HAR_ in output. Possible values are
    ``1`` (include) and ``0`` (exclude). Default is 0.
    If this option is ON the result will contain the same data
    as `render.har`_ provides under 'har' key.

    By default, response content is not included. To enable it use
    :ref:`'response_body' <arg-response-body>` option.

.. _arg-response-body:

response_body : int : optional
    Possible values are ``1`` and ``0``.  When ``response_body=1``,
    response content is included in HAR records. Default is
    ``response_body=0``. This option has no effect when
    both :ref:`'har' <arg-har>` and :ref:`'history' <arg-history>` are 0.


Examples
~~~~~~~~

By default, URL, requested URL, page title and frame geometry is returned::

    {
        "url": "http://crawlera.com/",
        "geometry": [0, 0, 640, 480],
        "requestedUrl": "http://crawlera.com/",
        "title": "Crawlera"
    }

Add 'html=1' to request to add HTML to the result::

    {
        "url": "http://crawlera.com/",
        "geometry": [0, 0, 640, 480],
        "requestedUrl": "http://crawlera.com/",
        "html": "<!DOCTYPE html><!--[if IE 8]>....",
        "title": "Crawlera"
    }

Add 'png=1' to request to add base64-encoded PNG screenshot to the result::

    {
        "url": "http://crawlera.com/",
        "geometry": [0, 0, 640, 480],
        "requestedUrl": "http://crawlera.com/",
        "png": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAAN...",
        "title": "Crawlera"
    }

Setting both 'html=1' and 'png=1' allows to get HTML and a screenshot
at the same time - this guarantees that the screenshot matches the HTML.

By adding "iframes=1" information about iframes could be obtained::

    {
        "geometry": [0, 0, 640, 480],
        "frameName": "",
        "title": "Scrapinghub | Autoscraping",
        "url": "http://scrapinghub.com/autoscraping.html",
        "childFrames": [
            {
                "title": "Tutorial: Scrapinghub's autoscraping tool - YouTube",
                "url": "",
                "geometry": [235, 502, 497, 310],
                "frameName": "<!--framePath //<!--frame0-->-->",
                "requestedUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/embed/lSJvVqDLOOs?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent",
                "childFrames": []
            }
        ],
        "requestedUrl": "http://scrapinghub.com/autoscraping.html"
    }

Note that iframes can be nested.

Pass both 'html=1' and 'iframes=1' to get HTML for all iframes
as well as for the main page::

     {
        "geometry": [0, 0, 640, 480],
        "frameName": "",
        "html": "<!DOCTYPE html...",
        "title": "Scrapinghub | Autoscraping",
        "url": "http://scrapinghub.com/autoscraping.html",
        "childFrames": [
            {
                "title": "Tutorial: Scrapinghub's autoscraping tool - YouTube",
                "url": "",
                "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>...",
                "geometry": [235, 502, 497, 310],
                "frameName": "<!--framePath //<!--frame0-->-->",
                "requestedUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/embed/lSJvVqDLOOs?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent",
                "childFrames": []
            }
        ],
        "requestedUrl": "http://scrapinghub.com/autoscraping.html"
    }

Unlike 'html=1', 'png=1' does not affect data in childFrames.

When executing JavaScript code (see :ref:`execute javascript`) add the
parameter 'script=1' to the request to include the code output in the result::

    {
        "url": "http://crawlera.com/",
        "geometry": [0, 0, 640, 480],
        "requestedUrl": "http://crawlera.com/",
        "title": "Crawlera",
        "script": "result of script..."
    }

The JavaScript code supports the console.log() function to log messages.
Add 'console=1' to the request to include the console output in the result::

    {
        "url": "http://crawlera.com/",
        "geometry": [0, 0, 640, 480],
        "requestedUrl": "http://crawlera.com/",
        "title": "Crawlera",
        "script": "result of script...",
        "console": ["first log message", "second log message", ...]
    }


Curl examples::

    # full information
    curl 'http://localhost:8050/render.json?url=http://domain.com/page-with-iframes.html&png=1&html=1&iframes=1'

    # HTML and meta information of page itself and all its iframes
    curl 'http://localhost:8050/render.json?url=http://domain.com/page-with-iframes.html&html=1&iframes=1'

    # only meta information (like page/iframes titles and urls)
    curl 'http://localhost:8050/render.json?url=http://domain.com/page-with-iframes.html&iframes=1'

    # render html and 320x240 thumbnail at once; do not return info about iframes
    curl 'http://localhost:8050/render.json?url=http://domain.com/page-with-iframes.html&html=1&png=1&width=320&height=240'

    # Render page and execute simple Javascript function, display the js output
    curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/javascript' \
        -d 'function getAd(x){ return x; } getAd("abc");' \
        'http://localhost:8050/render.json?url=http://domain.com&script=1'

    # Render page and execute simple Javascript function, display the js output and the console output
    curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/javascript' \
        -d 'function getAd(x){ return x; }; console.log("some log"); console.log("another log"); getAd("abc");' \
        'http://localhost:8050/render.json?url=http://domain.com&script=1&console=1'


.. _execute:

execute
-------

Execute a custom rendering script and return a result.

:ref:`render.html`, :ref:`render.png`, :ref:`render.jpeg`, :ref:`render.har`
and :ref:`render.json` endpoints cover many common use cases, but sometimes
they are not enough. This endpoint allows to write custom
:ref:`Splash Scripts <scripting-tutorial>`.

Arguments:

.. _arg-lua-source:

lua_source : string : required
  Browser automation script. See :ref:`scripting-tutorial` for more info.

.. _arg-execute-timeout:

timeout : float : optional
  Same as :ref:`'timeout' <arg-timeout>` argument for `render.html`_.

allowed_domains : string : optional
  Same as :ref:`'allowed_domains' <arg-allowed-domains>` argument for `render.html`_.

proxy : string : optional
  Same as :ref:`'proxy' <arg-proxy>` argument for `render.html`_.

filters : string : optional
  Same as :ref:`'filters' <arg-filters>` argument for `render.html`_.

save_args : JSON array or a comma-separated string : optional
  Same as :ref:`'save_args' <arg-save-args>` argument for `render.html`_.
  Note that you can save not only default Splash arguments,
  but any other parameters as well.

load_args : JSON object or a string : optional
  Same as :ref:`'load_args' <arg-load-args>` argument for `render.html`_.
  Note that you can load not only default Splash arguments,
  but any other parameters as well.

You can pass any other arguments. All arguments passed to :ref:`execute`
endpoint are available in a script in :ref:`splash.args <splash-args>` table.

.. _run:

run
---

This endpoint is the same as :ref:`execute`, but it wraps ``lua_source``
in ``function main(splash, args) ... end`` automatically.
For example, if you're sending this script to :ref:`execute`:

.. code-block:: lua

    funcion main(splash, args)
        assert(splash:go(args.url))
        assert(splash:wait(1.0))
        return splash:html()
    end

equivalent script for :ref:`run` endpoint would be

.. code-block:: lua

    assert(splash:go(args.url))
    assert(splash:wait(1.0))
    return splash:html()

.. _execute javascript:

Executing custom Javascript code within page context
----------------------------------------------------

.. note::

    See also: :ref:`executing JavaScript in Splash scripts <splash-jsfunc>`

Splash supports executing JavaScript code within the context of the page.
The JavaScript code is executed after the page finished loading (including
any delay defined by 'wait') but before the page is rendered. This allow to
use the javascript code to modify the page being rendered.

To execute JavaScript code use :ref:`js_source <arg-js-source>` parameter.
It should contain JavaScript code to be executed.

Note that browsers and proxies limit the amount of data can be sent using GET,
so it is a good idea to use ``content-type: application/json`` POST request.

Curl example::

    # Render page and modify its title dynamically
    curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
        -d '{"js_source": "document.title=\"My Title\";", "url": "http://example.com"}' \
        'http://localhost:8050/render.html'

Another way to do it is to use a POST request with the content-type set to
'application/javascript'. The body of the request should contain the code to
be executed.

Curl example::

    # Render page and modify its title dynamically
    curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/javascript' \
        -d 'document.title="My Title";' \
        'http://localhost:8050/render.html?url=http://domain.com'

To get the result of a javascript function executed within page
context use `render.json`_ endpoint with :ref:`script <arg-script>` = 1 parameter.

.. _javascript profiles:

Javascript Profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Splash supports "javascript profiles" that allows to preload javascript files.
Javascript files defined in a profile are executed after the page is loaded
and before any javascript code defined in the request.

The preloaded files can be used in the user's POST'ed code.

To enable javascript profiles support, run splash server with the
``--js-profiles-path=<path to a folder with js profiles>`` option::

    python3 -m splash.server --js-profiles-path=/etc/splash/js-profiles

.. note::

    See also: :ref:`splash and docker`.

Then create a directory with the name of the profile and place inside it the
javascript files to load (note they must be utf-8 encoded).
The files are loaded in the order they appear in the filesystem.
Directory example::

    /etc/splash/js-profiles/
                        mywebsite/
                              lib1.js

To apply this javascript profile add the parameter
``js=mywebsite`` to the request::

    curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/javascript' \
        -d 'myfunc("Hello");' \
        'http://localhost:8050/render.html?js=mywebsite&url=http://domain.com'

Note that this example assumes that myfunc is a javascript function
defined in lib1.js.

Javascript Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Splash is started with ``--js-cross-domain-access`` option

::

    $ docker run -it -p 8050:8050 scrapinghub/splash --js-cross-domain-access

then javascript code is allowed to access the content of iframes
loaded from a security origin diferent to the original page (browsers usually
disallow that). This feature is useful for scraping, e.g. to extract the
html of a iframe page. An example of its usage::

    curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/javascript' \
        -d 'function getContents(){ var f = document.getElementById("external"); return f.contentDocument.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].innerHTML; }; getContents();' \
        'http://localhost:8050/render.html?url=http://domain.com'

The javascript function 'getContents' will look for a iframe with
the id 'external' and extract its html contents.

Note that allowing cross origin javascript calls is a potential
security issue, since it is possible that secret information (i.e cookies)
is exposed when this support is enabled; also, some websites don't load
when cross-domain security is disabled, so this feature is OFF by default.

.. _request filters:

Request Filters
---------------

Splash supports filtering requests based on
`Adblock Plus <https://adblockplus.org/>`_ rules. You can use
filters from `EasyList`_ to remove ads and tracking codes
(and thus speedup page loading), and/or write filters manually to block
some of the requests (e.g. to prevent rendering of images, mp3 files,
custom fonts, etc.)

To activate request filtering support start splash with ``--filters-path``
option::

    python3 -m splash.server --filters-path=/etc/splash/filters

.. note::

    See also: :ref:`splash and docker`.


The folder ``--filters-path`` points to should contain ``.txt`` files with
filter rules in Adblock Plus format. You may download ``easylist.txt``
from EasyList_ and put it there, or create ``.txt`` files with your own rules.

For example, let's create a filter that will prevent custom fonts
in ``ttf`` and ``woff`` formats from loading (due to qt bugs they may cause
splash to segfault on Mac OS X)::

    ! put this to a /etc/splash/filters/nofonts.txt file
    ! comments start with an exclamation mark

    .ttf|
    .woff|

To use this filter in a request add ``filters=nofonts`` parameter
to the query::

    curl 'http://localhost:8050/render.png?url=http://domain.com/page-with-fonts.html&filters=nofonts'

You can apply several filters; separate them by comma::

    curl 'http://localhost:8050/render.png?url=http://domain.com/page-with-fonts.html&filters=nofonts,easylist'

If ``default.txt`` file is present in ``--filters-path`` folder it is
used by default when ``filters`` argument is not specified. Pass
``filters=none`` if you don't want default filters to be applied.

Only related resources are filtered out by request filters; 'main' page loading
request can't be blocked this way. If you really want to do that consider
checking URL against Adblock Plus filters before sending it to Splash
(e.g. for Python there is `adblockparser`_ library).

To learn about Adblock Plus filter syntax check these links:

* https://adblockplus.org/en/filter-cheatsheet
* https://adblockplus.org/en/filters

Splash doesn't support full Adblock Plus filters syntax, there are some
limitations:

* element hiding rules are not supported; filters can prevent network
  request from happening, but they can't hide parts of an already loaded page;
* only ``domain`` option is supported.

Unsupported rules are silently discarded.

.. note::

    If you want to stop downloading images check :ref:`'images' <arg-images>`
    parameter. It doesn't require URL-based filters to work, and it can
    filter images that are hard to detect using URL-based patterns.

.. warning::

    It is very important to have `pyre2 <https://github.com/axiak/pyre2>`_
    library installed if you are going to use filters with a large number
    of rules (this is the case for files downloaded from EasyList_).

    Without pyre2 library splash (via `adblockparser`_) relies on re module
    from stdlib, and it can be 1000x+ times slower than re2 - it may be
    faster to download files than to discard them if you have a large number
    of rules and don't use re2. With re2 matching becomes very fast.

    Make sure you are not using re2==0.2.20 installed from PyPI (it is broken);
    use the latest version.

.. _proxy profiles:

Proxy Profiles
--------------

Splash supports "proxy profiles" that allows to set proxy handling rules
per-request using ``proxy`` parameter.

To enable proxy profiles support, run splash server with
``--proxy-profiles-path=<path to a folder with proxy profiles>`` option::

    python3 -m splash.server --proxy-profiles-path=/etc/splash/proxy-profiles

.. note::

    If you run Splash using Docker, check :ref:`docker-folder-sharing`.

Then create an INI file with "proxy profile" config inside the
specified folder, e.g. ``/etc/splash/proxy-profiles/mywebsite.ini``.
Example contents of this file::

    [proxy]

    ; required
    host=proxy.crawlera.com
    port=8010

    ; optional, default is no auth
    username=username
    password=password

    ; optional, default is HTTP. Allowed values are HTTP and SOCKS5
    type=HTTP

    [rules]
    ; optional, default ".*"
    whitelist=
        .*mywebsite\.com.*

    ; optional, default is no blacklist
    blacklist=
        .*\.js.*
        .*\.css.*
        .*\.png

whitelist and blacklist are newline-separated lists of regexes.
If URL matches one of whitelist patterns and matches none of blacklist
patterns, proxy specified in ``[proxy]`` section is used;
no proxy is used otherwise.

Then, to apply proxy rules according to this profile,
add ``proxy=mywebsite`` parameter to request::

    curl 'http://localhost:8050/render.html?url=http://mywebsite.com/page-with-javascript.html&proxy=mywebsite'

If ``default.ini`` profile is present, it will be used when ``proxy``
argument is not specified. If you have ``default.ini`` profile
but don't want to apply it pass ``none`` as ``proxy`` value.


Other Endpoints
---------------

.. _http-gc:

_gc
~~~

To reclaim some RAM send a POST request to the ``/_gc`` endpoint::

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8050/_gc

It runs the Python garbage collector and clears internal WebKit caches.

.. _http-debug:

_debug
~~~~~~

To get debug information about Splash instance (max RSS used, number of used
file descriptors, active requests, request queue length, counts of alive
objects) send a GET request to the ``/_debug`` endpoint::

    curl http://localhost:8050/_debug

.. _http-ping:

_ping
~~~~~

To ping Splash instance send a GET request to the ``/_ping`` endpoint::

    curl http://localhost:8050/_ping

It returns "ok" status and max RSS used, if instance is alive.
