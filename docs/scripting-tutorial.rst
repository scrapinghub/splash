Splash Scripts Tutorial
=======================

Intro
-----

Splash can execute custom rendering scripts written in Lua_ programming language.
This allows to use Splash as a browser automation tool similar to PhantomJS_.
To execute a script and get the result back send it to :ref:`render.lua`
endpoint in a :ref:`lua_source <arg-lua-source>` argument.

.. note::

    Most likely you'll be able to follow Splash scripting examples even
    without knowing Lua. Nevertheless, the language worths learning - it
    is easy to get started and there are good online resources available,
    e.g. the `Programming in Lua`_ book.

.. _Programming in Lua: http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html
.. _Lua: http://www.lua.org/
.. _PhantomJS: http://phantomjs.org/

Let's start with a basic example:

.. code-block:: lua

     function main(splash)
         splash:go("http://example.com")
         splash:wait(0.5)
         local title = splash:runjs("document.title")
         return {title=title}
     end

If we submit this script to :ref:`render.lua` endpoint in a ``lua_source``
argument, Splash will go to example.com website, wait until it loads,
then wait 0.5s more, then get page title (by evaluating a JavaScript snippet
in page context), and then return the result as a JSON encoded object.

.. note::

    Splash UI provides an easy way to try scripts: there is a code editor
    for Lua and a button to submit a script to ``render.lua``. Visit
    http://127.0.0.1:8050/ (or whatever host/port Splash is listening to).

Entry Point: the "main" Function
--------------------------------

The script must provide "main" function; this function is called by Splash.
The result of this function is returned as an HTTP response.
Script could contain other helper functions and statements,
but 'main' is required.

In the first example 'main' function returned a Lua table (an associative array
similar to JavaScript Object or Python dict). Such results are returned as
JSON. This will return ``{"hello":"world!"}`` string as an HTTP response:

.. code-block:: lua

    function main(splash)
        return {hello="world!"}
    end

Script can also return a string:

.. code-block:: lua

    function main(splash)
        return 'hello'
    end

Strings are returned as-is (unlike tables they are not encoded to JSON).
Let's check it with curl::

    $ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8050/render.lua?lua_source=function+main%28splash%29%0D%0A++return+%27hello%27%0D%0Aend'
    hello

"main" function receives an object that allows to control the "browser tab".
All Splash features are exposed using this object. By a convention, this
argument is called "splash", but you are not required to follow this convention:

.. code-block:: lua

    function main(please)
        please:go("http://example.com")
        please:wait(0.5)
        return "ok"
    end

Calling Splash Methods
----------------------

Unlike many languages, in Lua methods are usually separated from an object
using a colon ``:``; to call "foo" method of "splash" object use
``splash:foo()`` syntax. See http://www.lua.org/pil/16.html for more details.

There are two main ways to call Lua methods in Splash scripts:
using positional and named arguments. To call a method using positional
arguments use parentheses ``splash:foo(val1, val2)``, to call it with
named arguments use curly braces: ``splash:foo{name1=val1, name2=val2}``:

.. code-block:: lua

    -- Examples of positional arguments:
    splash:go("http://example.com")
    splash:wait(0.5, false)
    local title = splash:runjs("document.title")

    -- The same using keyword arguments:
    splash:go{url="http://example.com"}
    splash:wait{time=0.5, cancel_on_redirect=false}
    local title = splash:runjs{source="document.title"}

    -- Mixed arguments example:
    splash:wait{0.5, cancel_on_redirect=false}

For the convenience all ``splash`` methods are designed to support both
styles of calling. But note that generally this convention is not
followed in Lua. There are no "real" named arguments in Lua, and most Lua
functions (including the ones from the standard library) choose to support
only one style of calling. Check http://www.lua.org/pil/5.3.html for more info.

Where Are My Callbacks?
-----------------------

Here is a part of the first example:

.. code-block:: lua

    splash:go("http://example.com")
    splash:wait(0.5)
    local title = splash:runjs("document.title")

The code looks like a standard procedural code; there are no callbacks
or fancy control flow structures. It doesn't mean Splash works in a synchronous
way; under the hood it is still async. When you call ``splash.wait(0.5)``,
Splash switches from the script to other tasks, and comes back after 0.5s.

It is possible to use loops, conditional statements, functions as usual
in Splash scripts; this enables a more straightforward code.

Let's check an `example <https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/blob/master/examples/follow.js>`__
PhantomJS script:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var users = ["PhantomJS", "ariyahidayat", /*...*/];

    function followers(user, callback) {
        var page = require('webpage').create();
        page.open('http://mobile.twitter.com/' + user, function (status) {
            if (status === 'fail') {
                console.log(user + ': ?');
            } else {
                var data = page.evaluate(function () {
                    return document.querySelector('div.profile td.stat.stat-last div.statnum').innerText;
                });
                console.log(user + ': ' + data);
            }
            page.close();
            callback.apply();
        });
    }
    function process() {
        if (users.length > 0) {
            var user = users[0];
            users.splice(0, 1);
            followers(user, process);
        } else {
            phantom.exit();
        }
    }
    process();

The code is arguably tricky: ``process`` function implements a loop
by creating a chain of callbacks; ``followers`` function doesn't return a value
(it would be more complex to implement) - the result is logged to the console
instead.

A similar Splash script:

.. code-block:: lua

    users = {'PhantomJS', 'ariyahidayat'}

    function followers(splash, user)
        local ok, msg = splash:go('http://mobile.twitter.com/' .. user)
        if not ok then
            return "?"
        end
        return splash:runjs([[
            document.querySelector('div.profile td.stat.stat-last div.statnum').innerText;
        ]]);
    end

    function process(splash, users)
        local result = {}
        for idx, user in ipairs(users) do
            result[user] = followers(splash, user)
        end
        return result
    end

    function main(splash)
        local users = process(splash, users)
        return {users=users}
    end

Observations:

* some Lua knowledge is helpful to be productive in Splash Scripts:
  ``ipairs``, ``[[multi-line strings]]`` or string concatenation via
  ``..`` could be unfamiliar;
* in Splash variant ``followers`` function can return a result
  (a number of twitter followers); also, it doesn't need a "callback" argument;
* instead of a ``page.open`` callback which receives "status" argument
  there is a "blocking" ``splash:go`` call which returns "ok" flag;
* error handling is different: in case of an HTTP 4xx or 5xx error
  PhantomJS doesn't return an error code to ``page.open`` callback - example
  script will try to get the followers nevertheless because "status" won't
  be "fail"; in Splash this error will be detected and "?" will be returned;
* ``process`` function can use a standard Lua ``for`` loop without
  a need to create a recursive callback chain;
* instead of console messages we've got a JSON HTTP API;
* apparently, PhantomJS allows to create multiple ``page`` objects and
  run several ``page.open`` requests in parallel (?); Splash only provides
  a single "browser tab" to a script via its ``splash`` parameter of ``main``
  function (but you're free to send multiple concurrent requests with
  Lua scripts to Splash).

There are great PhantomJS wrappers like CasperJS_ and NightmareJS_ which
(among other things) bring a sync-looking syntax to PhantomJS scripts by
providing custom control flow mini-languages. However, they all have their
own gotchas and edge cases (loops? moving code to helper functions? error
handling?). Splash scripts are standard Lua code.

.. note::

    PhantomJS itself and its wrappers are great, they deserve lots of
    respect; please don't take this writeup as an attack on them.
    These tools are much more mature and feature complete than Splash.
    Splash tries to look at the problem from a different angle, but
    for each unique Splash feature there are ten unique PhantomJS features.

Living Without Callbacks
------------------------

In Splash scripts it is not explicit which calls are async and which calls
are blocking. It is a common criticism of coroutines/greenlets; check e.g.
`this <https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2014/02/unyielding.html>`__ article
for a good description of the problem. However, we feel that in Splash scripts
negative effects are not quite there: scripts are meant to be small,
shared state is minimized, and an API is designed to execute a single
command at time, so in most cases the control flow is linear.

If you want to be safe then think of all ``splash`` methods as of async;
consider that after you call ``splash:foo()`` a webpage being
rendered can change. Often that's the point of calling a method,
e.g. ``splash:wait(time)`` or ``splash:go(url)`` only make sense because
webpage changes after calling them, but still - keep it in mind.

Currently the only async methods are :ref:`splash-go` and :ref:`splash-wait`.
Most splash methods are currently **not** async, but thinking of them as
of async will allow your scripts to work if we ever change that.

.. note::

    For the curious, Splash uses Lua coroutines under the hood.

    Internally, "main" function is executed as a coroutine by Splash,
    and some of the ``splash:foo()`` methods use ``coroutine.yield``.
    See http://www.lua.org/pil/9.html for Lua coroutines tutorial.

Error Handling
--------------

There are two ways to report errors in Lua: raise an exception and return
an error flag. See http://www.lua.org/pil/8.3.html.

Splash uses the following convention:

1. for developer errors (e.g. incorrect function arguments) exception is raised;
2. for errors outside developer control (e.g. a non-responding remote website)
   status flag is returned: functions that can fail return ``ok, reason``
   pairs which developer can either handle or ignore.

If ``main`` results in an unhandled exception then Splash returns HTTP 400
response with an error message.

It is possible to raise an exception manually using Lua ``error`` function:

.. code-block:: lua

    error("A message to be returned in a HTTP 400 response")

To handle Lua exceptions (and prevent Splash from returning HTTP 400 response)
use Lua ``pcall``; see http://www.lua.org/pil/8.4.html.

To convert "status flag" errors to exceptions Lua ``assert`` function can be used.
For example, if you expect a website to work and don't want to handle errors
manually, then ``assert`` allows to stop processing and return HTTP 400
if the assumption is wrong:

.. code-block:: lua

    local ok, msg = splash:go("http://example.com")
    if not ok then
        -- handle error somehow, e.g.
        error(msg)
    end

    -- a shortcut for the code above: use assert
    assert(splash:go("http://example.com"))
